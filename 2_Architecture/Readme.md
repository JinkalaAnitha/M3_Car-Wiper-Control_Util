# State Diagram of Wiper Control System
The Car Wipers clean the front window or screen of car Based on the switch and different LED's.When Press Switch, the car wiper will start to clean front screen when there is water.Basically this system is developed on rainy situation to optimize or detect Accidents.Finall the wapers clean the water on front screen of a car.The state diagram of Car Wiper Control System is given by,
